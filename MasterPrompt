**Goal:**
Create a responsive, bilingual (CZ/EN), and highly interactive, and graphically attractive and original website using Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. The site must feel inovative, confident, expensive but warm and human.

# Input Data & Assets

2.  `photos/`: Denisa's professional photos. Use them on the web.
3.  `Text-na-web-mně`: Source text for Bio, Story, and USP. Dont change the text. Use only the text that is given here when talking about Denisa.

# Technical Requirements
1.  **Stack:** Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Lucide React (icons).
2.  **Localization:**
    * Default language: **Czech (CZ)** if the user is in the Czech Republic.
    * Fallback/International: **English (EN)**.
    * Include a visible **Language Toggle** in the Navbar (CZ | EN).
    * Implement logic to detect locale or default to CZ, but allow manual override.
3.  **Colors:**
    * Primary Accent: `#6100D1` (Light Purple).
    * Secondary: `#4D007A` (Dark Purple).
    * Background: when displaying client logos- white. Otherwise I will leave it to you, as to a graphic designer.
    
 4.  **SEO:** Fully optimized (Meta tags, OpenGraph, Semantic HTML).

# Content Strategy & Layout (Strict Order)

## 1. Navbar
* Logo (Denisa Rohunová).
* Links: O mně (About), Služby (Services), Reference, Kontakt.
* Language Switcher.
* CTA Button: "Domluvit konzultaci" (Links to Cal.com).

## 2. Hero Section (The Hook)
* **Visual:** High-quality photo of Denisa from `photos/`.
* **Headline:** "From Code to Leadership. Your Guide to AI Transformation." (Translate to CZ based on locale).
* **Subheadline:** Highlight the "Tech Expertise + Human Empathy" USP.
* **Trust Badge:** Display **"🏆 EU Innovation Star 2024 Winner"** prominently near the headline.
* **CTA:** Button linking to the Booking section.

## 3. Client Logos (Trust)
* **Design Constraint:** The logos in `client-logos/` have **WHITE backgrounds**.
* **Solution:** This section's background MUST be `#FFFFFF` (White) so the logo boxes blend in invisibly.
* **Layout:** A responsive grid or marquee. Use CSS `object-fit: contain` and specific heights to make all logos look symmetrical and visually balanced regardless of their original aspect ratio.

## 4. Services (The Offer)
* **Core Message:** "Transformation of Teams".
* **Key Feature (MUST STAND OUT):** The **Subsidy (Dotace)** Card.
    * Text: "Možnost využití 85-100% dotace" (85-100% Funding Available).
    * Design: Use the Purple `#6100D1` to make this pop. It is a major selling point.
    * Note: Denisa's team handles the paperwork.

## 5. About Me (The Story & Authority)
* **Source:** Use `Text-na-web-mně`.
* **Narrative:** Connect the dots:
    * **Ex-Pro Squash Player** (National Champion, European TOP 6) -> Discipline & Energy.
    * **Ex-Fullstack Developer** (Greenfox Academy, 472+ hrs) -> Technical Deep Dive.
    * **EU Innovation Star 2024** -> International Recognition.
    * **Roles:** Co-founder Taskyo, MSIC Expert Group, AI & Business Lab Mentor.

## 6. Testimonials (Social Proof)
* **Source:** `mojeReference`.
* **Layout:**
    * Grid of text reviews.
    * Two Video Testimonials (YouTube embeds). Make them responsive.

* **Design:** Each review must show the Client Name, Role, Company, and their Photo.
    * *Constraint:* Client photos are different sizes. CSS Force them into perfect circles (`rounded-full`) of the same dimension (e.g., `w-16 h-16`) with `object-fit: cover`.

## 7. Media & Podcast
* **Source:** `podcast a vystoupení`.
* **Content:** Embed the Podcast video and the link to the Czech TV appearance.

## 8. Contact Section (Conversion)
* **Layout:** Split view (Left: Contact Info, Right: Form).
* **Contact Info:**
    * Email: `denisa@taskyo.cz` (clickable mailto).
    * LinkedIn: [Denisa Rohunová](https://www.linkedin.com/in/denisa-rohunov%C3%A1-001a25225/) (Use LinkedIn Icon).
* **Contact Form:**
    * Fields: Name, Email, Message.
    * Action: Configure it to send data to `denisa@taskyo.cz` (set up the UI and API route structure).
* **Booking Widget:**
    * Embed **Cal.com** directly here: `https://cal.com/denisa-rohunova-k2mxqr/30min`.
    * Make sure the iframe is responsive.

# Execution Instructions
1.  Analyze the provided text files to extract the exact copy.
2.  Set up the Next.js project structure with `next-intl` for localization.
3.  Build the components mobile-first.
4.  Apply `Framer Motion` for subtle entrance animations (fade-in up) as the user scrolls.
5.  Ensure the "White Background" rule for logos is strictly followed.
6. Ensure the photos look very natural on the screen (you can adjust them graphically)
7. Ensure the buttons are visible
8. Ensure you display the logo "Denisa Rohunova" on the left up site. You will find it in the document "photos". If user clicks at it, it will get him to the home page.
9. Ensure the whole page will be extra user friendly and attractive and dynamic.
10. Ensure the long texts are interactive and not boring. 
11. Ensure that when a website is in English - all texts on the web will be translated to ENGLISH including testemonials. When the language is setup to CZECH-all texts will be in Czech including testemonials.
12. Ensure the web is docker ready - I will upload it to a custom domain on wedos.cz afterwards

**Start by initializing the project and building the Hero and Logo sections.**
